## Introduction

### Overview
DoS/DDoS attacks aim to make online services unavailable by overwhelming them with traffic from multiple sources. They are among the most robust cyber threats today due to their simplicity, the difficulty of defense, and their potential to cause significant operational and financial harm.

## Preparation

### Identify Critical Assets and Services
- Catalog services accessible via the public internet, noting their security posture.
- Rank assets based on importance and requirement for availability.

### Gain Insight into Network Access
- Document how users access the network, including remote access via VPNs.
- Identify potential network bottlenecks and strategies to mitigate disruptions.

### DDoS Protection Service Enrollment
- Evaluate and enroll in a DDoS protection service tailored to the organization's critical assets.

### High-Availability and Load-Balancing Design
- Review network designs to eliminate single points of failure.
- Implement high-availability setups or distribute services across multiple nodes.

### Service Provider Cyber Defense Evaluation
- Discuss with ISPs or Cloud Providers about their DDoS defense mechanisms.
- Review contracts for details on offered protections and potential risks.

### Incident Response Team Formation
- Establish an incident response team with defined roles and responsibilities.
- Develop an organization-specific DDoS response and business continuity plan.

## Identification

### Goal: Detect a DDoS attack promptly and accurately.

### Monitoring and Alert Setup
- Implement continuous monitoring with alerts for unusual traffic patterns indicative of a DDoS attack.

### Early Detection Tools
- Implement real-time DDoS detection tools.

### Traffic Baseline Establishment
- Regular monitoring to establish normal traffic patterns.

### Alert Configuration 
- Set alerts for significant deviations from the baseline. Check for sudden spike of traffic that occurs at regular intervals or at unusual time frames
from a single IP address or multiple IP addresses 

### Verification
- Ensure that the loss of service is not due to other factors such as an internal server fault, or an Internet/Cloud Service Provider outage.
- Check if the organisation is expecting a large volume of traffic (i.e. Newservice or product launch, time-limited promotions, etc.)
- Confirm an attack by analyzing traffic sources, volume, and types against known DDoS patterns.

### Notification
- Inform the incident response team to initiate the response plan.

## Containment

### Goal: Minimize the attack's impact on services and the network.

### Traffic Diversion
- Redirect traffic through DDoS protection services for mitigation.

### Rate Limiting and Filtering
- Apply rate limiting and filter traffic to reduce the attack's impact.

### ISP Coordination
- Engage with ISPs for additional mitigation strategies, including possible rerouting of traffic.

### Geoblocking 
- Temporarily block traffic from regions identified as sources of the attack.

## Eradication

### Goal: Eliminate the threat from the environment.

### Security Posture Adjustment 
- Tweak firewall and IDS/IPS settings against the attack vector.

### Attack Mitigation Tools 
- Activate specific mitigation hardware/software.

### Source Blocking
- Block IP addresses identified as part of the attack.

## Recovery

### Goal: Safely restore normal operations.

### Service Restoration
- Gradually restore services while monitoring for stability and signs of the attack persisting.

### System and Network Updates
- Apply updates to system and network configurations to close exploited vulnerabilities.

### Removal of Temporary Measures
- Remove containment and eradication measures that are no longer necessary.

### Monitoring Post-Attack 
- Implement enhanced monitoring for signs of renewed attacks.

## Post-Incident Analysis

### Goal: Analyze the incident to improve future response and prevent recurrence.

### Attack Analysis
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the attack vectors and exploited vulnerabilities.

### Response Evaluation
- Review the effectiveness of the incident response, including areas for improvement.

### Plan Update
- Update the incident response plan based on lessons learned from the attack and analysis.
